SuckLess is a collection of PHP classes and helper functions with a sole
purpose of making web development in PHP suck less, hopefully.

Developers are encouraged to extract whatever they find useful in this
collection and deploy in their projects.  So feel free to dig around.

All codes in this collection are primarily written for PHP 5.3.0 and beyond.
Unless stated otherwise, support for versions prior to PHP 5.3.0 is not
guaranteed.
